# DAT235 project description

##Project summary
An area of interest in the interaction between the social sciences and computer science / mathematics is the notion
of qualitative, or imprecise, reasoning. The goal of this project is to develop domain specific languages
for modelling and decision making in Climate Resilient Urban Design. At the core of the project lies
the concept of Causal Loop Diagrams, a qualitative abstraction of decision making and causality. Part of the project
will involve formalising the semantics of Causal Loop Diagrams in terms of, maybe, a probabilistic model
derived from the work of Wellman, Renooij, and Silja among others on Qualitative Probabilistic Networks.
This work will hopefully help connect some of the abstract notions in social science to mathematical and formal
foundations through the use of domain specific languages.

##Builds on courses
Advanced Functional Programming, Domain Specific Languages of Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Probability Theory
