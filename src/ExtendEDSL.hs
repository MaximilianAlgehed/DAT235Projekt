-- the problem with this is that
-- the expressions are not from the
-- rest of the program.
--
-- You can't even write:
--  g <- do
--          iff condition
--              (get 5)
--              (get 6)
--  becuase it now becomes expressions in the
--  Data syntax ...

-- The idea here is that we pass around the
-- expression that frees up interm groups untill

-- To note is that this examples mixes the "GetGroup" and "CComm" extensions to the (Program ...) monad
--
-- We would like to have a type that looks something like:
-- (HighExp :<: groupExp, groupExp :~>: Prog HighExp, HighExp :<: ccommExp, ccommExp :~>: Prog HighExp) =>
-- Free (GetGroup groupExp :+: CComm ccommExp :+: Program CMD ...) ()
--
-- or something like that. We would like to capture that HighExp and CType etc. lift to the
-- high level DSLs. One difficulty is how to connect the two extensions, do you require that
-- there is a bijection between groupExp and ccommExp for an instance?
-- Is there a way for the user to choose how much interaction the two DSLs can have etc.
--
-- Thoughts?
